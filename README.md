# C-Live-Project

I participated in an ongoing project where I contributed to updating and designing a website for a theatre company in Portland, Oregon. 

The site is for users to manage their subscriptions easily. 

I completed three stories which was designing the Home Page, adding a Cast Members group to the database, and designing the Create/Edit Pages. 
I encountered roadblocks which were mainly issues with positioning images due to their size.
